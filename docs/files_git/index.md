# Files and Git

## Post-It™ protocol

You'll spend a big chunk of class time working on examples and problems. To keep things organized, we'll be issuing you green and red Post-It™ stickers that we'll expect you to use like this: 

- <span style="color:green">Green:</span> I've finished the current exercise—no problems.
- <span style="color:red">Red:</span> Help! I'm stuck!

Stick the appropriate sticker to the top of your laptop screen, so we can see it. The green one will tell us when it's OK to resume the lesson. The red one will save you having to wave your hand or do other more obnoxious things to get our attention if you need help.

(I.e., use them like the little plastic flags on top of the GIS lab monitors.)

## Software installation

- **GitHub**

  If you already have a GitHub account, skip this step.

  Otherwise, [request a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

  - Be sure to make it a **student** account: this will allow you to create both private and public projects ("repositories") on GitHub for free. (Non-student accounts have to pay to create private repositories.)

  We do this step first, since it can take several minutes for the account request to be processed.

- **Git**

  If you took 244 last quarter, you probably have the most recent version of Git (2.6.2 or higher) installed.

  Otherwise, download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

  - **Windows users:** You will now be able to open a Unix shell in any folder (including the Desktop) by right-clicking on the folder and selecting *Git Bash Here*
  - **Mac users:** Download and install [Go2Shell](http://zipzapmac.com/go2shell). You will now be able to open a Unix shell in any folder by clicking the Go2Shell button in the folder's Finder toolbar.

- **R**

  If you already have the most recent versions of R (3.4.4) and RStudio (1.1.423) installed, skip this step.

  Otherwise, download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## The Unix shell

- [Software Carpentry tutorial: The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
  - We'll work through lesson 4, "Pipes and Filters"

## Git

- [Software Carpentry tutorial: Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
  - We'll work through lesson 9, "Conflicts"
  - and then do lesson 14, "Supplemental: Using Git from RStudio"
