### Introduction

In this lab we'll explore how to use a *relational database* to store and retrieve tabular data. We'll use the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) software, which manages a complete multi-table relational database as a single Mac or Windows file. (In fact, SQLite database files are *portable*: an SQLite database created on a Mac can be copied to and used on Windows, and vice versa.)

### Software setup

- **Mac:** You should already have SQLite installed.

- **Windows:**
    1. On the [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html), download the "bundle of command-line tools" in the "Precompiled Binaries for Windows" section.
    2. Unzip the bundle in your `Downloads` folder.
    3. Right-click *Git Bash Here* in the `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3230100` folder (the numbers at the end of the folder name may be different).
    4. Enter the command `cp sqlite3.exe $HOME`

Test your setup by opening a Terminal window in RStudio and entering the command `sqlite3`. You should see:

```
SQLite version (version number, date, and time)
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite>
```

Enter the command `.q` to exit SQLite.

### Tutorials

- [Software Carpentry tutorial: Databases and SQL](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
    - We'll work through pretty much the whole thing (some parts faster than others... and we'll skip the Python stuff)
    
- [Introduction to `dbplyr`](http://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dbplyr.html)
    - We'll explore how databases are connected to the tidyverse packages (`dplyr`, `tibble`, etc.)
